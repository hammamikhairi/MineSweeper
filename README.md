# MineSweeper

The board is divided into cells, with mines randomly distributed. To win, you need to open all the cells (left click). The number on a cell shows the number of mines adjacent to it.You can determine cells that are safe, and cells that contain mines. Cells suspected of being mines can be marked with a flag using the right mouse button.
